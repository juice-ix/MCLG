Truth tables generate from LSB -> MSB in the array, regardless of which inputs have what starter ID.
However, output ID's are specified by the user before compiling the array by assigning output blocks an outputID.
This output ID corresponds to it's position within the output array. E.g. output[0] = (__outputId__ = 0)

For a full adder, this means:
    Cin = input[0]
    B = input[1]
    A = input[2]

In ripple carry adders, this pattern applies, except you can ignore Cin, as it's not an input unless it's the first full adder.
